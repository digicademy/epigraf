Epigraf manages separate databases for different projects.
Click the top left button to open the database management page.

New databases are created by administrators in the database management page.
A project database comprises an SQL database and a folder for additional files.

After creating a new database, it needs to be configured.
This involves creating a types configuration to adapt the database to a use case and to import
data such as the properties used to annotate content.

Instead of starting from scratch, you can transfer the configuration of an existing database,
import it from CSV or XML files or generate it using the API.

On the database management page, you will find buttons to backup a database or
to restore backups. To duplicate a database, first, create a backup. Second,
create a new database and import the backup.
