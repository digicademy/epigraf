Notes and the wiki are used for the coordination of research efforts.
For example, you can store common editing guidelines or a codebook for content analyses in the notes.
While notes are specific to a project database, the wiki is accessible to all users on a server.

Make sure to remove the domain from internal links and when including images in the wiki, public pages or notes.
In addition, always remove any superfluous parameters, especially the database parameter.
For example, use `/wiki` instead of `https://epigraf.inschriften.net/wiki?database=public`.
