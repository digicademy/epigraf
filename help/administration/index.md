Epigraf can handle different research teams on the same server.
Each research team, usually, works on a separate database.

Administrators have access to all data on a server.
Thus, they manage the available databases and user accounts.
Moreover, they organise data imports, export pipelines,
and integration of Epigraf with the research organisations infrastructure.

It is advised that administrators have a good understanding of Epigraf's core concepts.
